## Steps
1. Inspect car from the outside (look through windows, etc.). Don't call the owner unless this initial inspection goes to your liking

## Visual inspection with owner
### Engine/powertrain
- [ ] **Before startup**
  - [ ] Hood pops open easily?
  - [ ] Hood support/struts work and keep hood open
  - [ ] Is the engine clean or dirty? At times a clean engine means it was detailed and can mean they are attempting to hide leaks
  - [ ] Frame (straight, no kinks)
  - [ ] Any damaged parts or parts that look much newer than the others?
  - [ ] Inspect for leaks (oil, coolant, transmission, etc.)
  - [ ] Pull oil dipstick and inspect oil level

  - [ ] Check coolant level (make sure the engine is NOT HOT when you do this)
  - [ ] Check hoses (squeeze them too) to check for cracks, stiffness (or softness), damage in general
